<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a software engineer at a FinTech firm, fueled by a passion for crafting impactful technology that blends human-computer interaction, natural sciences, and design. In my free time, you can find me reading books, clicking pictures, shooting guns or indulging in conversations where we end up solving world's problems.</p>
