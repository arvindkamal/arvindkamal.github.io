[//]: # (hook/story)
Ever had an idea sit in the back of your mind for so long it practically gathered dust? That was me with blogging - something I’d toyed with for years but never acted on. Then, during a train ride, while chatting with my friend, Taylor (a seasoned blogger herself), about life beyond work, the topic came up. I mentioned my ever-growing backlog of ideas with nowhere to put them. Taylor, ever the enabler of creative pursuits, casually asked, “So why not start a blog? As someone who’s been blogging for years, I can tell you - you’re already doing the hard part: overthinking. Now, just write.” And just like that, what had long been a pile of tinder - half-formed ideas and good intentions - finally caught fire.

In this post, I want to talk about blogging, why it is worth considering, what I plan to write about, and most importantly, how this blog might just bring value to you.

[//]: # (what is blogging)
I was mildly amused to realize that both, the word "blog" and I, can trace our origins back to the same year — 1997. While I was busy learning to walk, blog (formerly known as “we**b-log**”) was finding its footing on the internet as a digital diary for the opinionated. By 2004, when we were both seven, one of us had influenced a U.S. election and had become the most searched word of the year. The other was busy practicing cursive handwriting.

[//]: # (why am I blogging / what will I blog about)
Which brings me to why I’m engaging with my year-mate by starting this blog. Simply put, my brain has been in hoarder mode. The inputs keep piling up, but the outputs... are practically on life support. So, consider this blog a creative defibrillator - my first attempt at jumpstarting the flow of ideas again. It’s part journal, part brain-dump, part book-club-that-exists-only-in-my-head. Whether it’s breaking down a concept I just learned, sharing thoughts on a recent read, or simply unloading whatever’s been on my mind, it all lands here.

[//]: # (how will my blogs bring value to you)
While my reasons for blogging may seem a bit self-indulgent so far, my hope is that this becomes a mutually rewarding experience for both - me, the writer, and you, the reader. Time is, arguably, our most valuable resource, and if you’re choosing to spend some of yours here, I'd want to make it worth your while. Whether it’s through an interesting insight, a fresh perspective, or just a well-placed joke, I’d like to ensure that this little exchange of time and thought benefits us both.

A good read should linger, even after the words have concluded; If this one did, then my job here is done - until next time.
